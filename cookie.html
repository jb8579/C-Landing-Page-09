                                        <p>Cookies are small data files placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. These files help websites remember your actions and preferences (such as login, language, and display preferences) over a period of time, so you donâ€™t have to re-enter them whenever you come back to the site or browse from one page to another. They can also be used to track browsing habits to tailor advertising to your interests.</p>
                                        
                                        <h5>How Do We Use Cookies?</h5>
                                        <p>We use cookies for a variety of reasons detailed below. Unfortunately, in most cases, there are no industry-standard options for disabling cookies without completely disabling the functionality and features they add to this site. It is recommended that you leave all cookies on if you are not sure whether you need them, as they may provide services that you use.</p>
                                        
                                        <h5>Types of Cookies We Use</h5>
                                        <p>We use different types of cookies on our website, each serving different purposes to enhance your experience:</p>
                                        
                                        <p><strong>1. Essential Cookies:</strong> These cookies are necessary for the website to function and cannot be switched off in our systems. They are usually set in response to actions made by you, such as setting your privacy preferences, logging in, or filling in forms. Without these cookies, some parts of the website may not function properly.</p>
                                        
                                        <p><strong>2. Analytical/Performance Cookies:</strong> These cookies help us understand how visitors interact with our website by collecting and reporting information anonymously.

                                        <p><strong>3. Functionality Cookies:</strong> These cookies allow the website to remember choices you make (such as your username, language, or the region you are in) and provide enhanced, more personal features. The information collected by these cookies is typically anonymized, meaning it does not track your browsing activity on other websites.</p>
                                        
                                        <p><strong>4. Targeting/Advertising Cookies:</strong> These cookies are used to deliver advertisements that are more relevant to you and your interests. They also limit the number of times you see an ad and help measure the effectiveness of advertising campaigns. These cookies remember that you have visited a website and may be shared with other organizations, such as advertisers. Targeting cookies are often linked to site functionality provided by the other organization.</p>

Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. However, please be aware that disabling cookies may affect the functionality of this and many other websites you visit.
